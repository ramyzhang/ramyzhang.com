            <h3>a bit about me</h3>
            <p><span class="hi_salmon">basics.</span></p>
            <p>i'm a 2024 new grad from the university of toronto, with a double major in <i>computer science</i> and <i>cognitive science!</i> i'm currently working with public sector clients at <a href="https://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a> as a software developer intern. i spent most of my time in my undergrad developing <a href="https://mimimosa.itch.io/">games</a> and leading <a href="https://github.com/uoftblueprint/sistema">pro bono software projects</a> for non-profits.</p>
            <p>in the past, i interned as a founder's associate at <a href="https://opal.so/">opal</a>; a software developer at <a href="https://u.cash/">U.CASH</a>; as well as a business technology analyst at <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/">deloitte</a>.</p>
            
            <p><span class="hi_salmon">games.</span></p>
            <p>i played all kinds of wacky MMOs on the early 2000s internet as a kid, but didn't get deeper into gaming until university. i fell in love with how devs craft satisfying yet challenging experiences through carefully designed mechanics, tuned to perfection - a real labour of love!</p>
            <p>a couple of years ago, i started making games with friends, experimenting with different engines and even <a href="https://github.com/ramyzhang/minimi-engine">building my own</a> in C++ and SDL2. my dream is to create games that will delight, comfort, and immerse generations of players.</p>
            <p>you can find some of my projects on my <a href="https://mimimosa.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page. i am currently looking for <i>full-time junior opportunities</i> in games - if you are hiring a developer, please contact me via any of the links <a a href="links.html">here</a>!</p>
            
            <p><span class="hi_salmon">music.</span></p>
            <p>when i was 11, i began singing in vocal competitions, winning both national and international awards; being so young, my self-identity as a musician became quite twisted. i decided to take more control and began writing and producing my own music instead.</p>
            <p>nowadays, in my free time, i work on making music for my <a href="https://ramyzhang.bandcamp.com/">personal artist project</a> and also perform as the lead vocalist of an incredible band, called the <a href="https://deezedmancollective.com">DMC</a>. i've played in venues across north america and china.</p>
            <p>music has kept me company through all of the highs and lows of my life, and i know i'll continue to treasure it throughout my remaining years.</p>
