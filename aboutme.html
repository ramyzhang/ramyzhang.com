          <h3>a bit about me</h3>
          <p><span class="hi_salmon">programming.</span></p>
          <p>i'm a 2024 new grad from the university of toronto, with a double major in computer science and cognitive science! i'm currently building software for public sector clients at CGI as a software developer intern. during my undergrad, i was an executive member of our school's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/utGDDC/"><b>game design and development club</b></a> (utGDDC) for three years, and am proud of having previously been project lead for <a href="https://uoftblueprint.org/#/"><b>uoft blueprint</b></a>'s pro bono project for <a href="https://www.sistema-toronto.ca/"><b>sistema toronto</b></a>, a non-profit for early childhood music education.</p>
          <p>in the past, i interned as a founder's associate at <a href="https://opal.so/"><b>opal</b></a> to build out a community platform for people seeking focus; a software developer at <a href="https://u.cash/"><b>U.CASH</b></a>, a digital asset converter startup for the unbanked; as well as a business technology analyst at <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/"><b>deloitte digital</b></a>, where I worked on wearable prototyping.</p>
          
          <p><span class="hi_salmon">games.</span></p>
          <p>i'm a bit of a gaming late bloomer - i played all kinds of wacky MMOs on the early 2000s internet as a kid, but didn't delve deeper because of financial barriers to console gaming. once i got into university, i fell back in love with games and how they deliver stories and craft these satisfying yet challenging experiences through carefully designed levels and mechanics, tuned to perfection. these inspired me so much i decided to make my own little interactive digital simulations too! throughout university, i joined several game jams to build several small games, experimenting with different engines like Unity and Unreal (and even building my own with SDL2), trying new gameplay mechanics, implementing game audio, and designing sounds, along with many talented friends. i want to create things to delight and immerse generations of players, the same way my favourite games have given me hundreds of hours of inspiration. you can find some of my projects on my <a href="https://mimimosa.itch.io/"><b>itch.io</b></a> page.</p>
          <p>i am currently looking for full-time junior opportunities in games - if you are hiring a developer, please contact me via any of the links <a a href="links.html">here</a>!</p>
          
          <p><span class="hi_salmon">music.</span></p>
          <p>i've been in the singing competition space since i was 11, winning both national and international awards. since then, i've moved towards finding a voice that's more my own. i've been a freelance topline writer and session vocalist for 5 years now, as well as a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2nnVALuxBdarHJE54hCQDU?si=r4rgz0eeSgyuMEzNtonmZw"><b>self-produced artist</b></a> and lead vocalist of an incredible band, called the <a href="https://deezedmancollective.com"><b>DMC</b></a>. together, we have played in venues across north america, myself standing on stages in china as well. music is one of my most beloved interests, and i know it will keep me company for a very long time throughout the rest of my life!</p>
